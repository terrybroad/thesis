First and foremost I would like to thank my supervisors Professor Mick Grierson and Professor Frederic Fol Leymarie for their dedicated support over the long journey of this research. I would also like to thank Professor Rebecca Fiebrink and Professor Matthew Yee-King for the invaluable feedback in my upgrade examination, which massively influenced the final shape of this thesis. Additionally, I would like to thank the examiners of this PhD, Professor Phillipe Pasquier and Professor Marco Gillies, for their time and the thoughtful questions they prepared for what was a very enjoyable viva.
