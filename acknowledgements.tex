\chapter*{Acknowledgements}

First and foremost I would like to thank my supervisors Professor Mick Grierson and Professor Frederic Fol Leymarie for their dedicated support over the long journey of this research. I would also like to thank Professor Rebecca Fiebrink and Professor Matthew Yee-King for the invaluable feedback in my upgrade examination, which massively influenced the final shape of this thesis. Additionally, I would like to thank the examiners of this PhD, Professor Phillipe Pasquier and Professor Marco Gillies, for their time and the thoughtful questions they prepared for what was a very enjoyable viva. 

I would like to thank my friend and PhD colleague Sebastian Berns for coining the term \textit{active divergence} that succinctly defined and tied together what I had thought were very disparate pieces of research when I had originally conducted them. I would like to thank the principal investigators, admin team and fellow students from the Centre for Doctoral Training in Intelligent Games and Game Intelligence (IGGI; grant EP/L015846/1) for providing the support and community to make this PhD possible. I would also like to thank Sara Bodinar and Jan Birley from Writers Retreat UK for providing the space and mentorship during my retreat there in 2023 where the overarching narrative and title of this thesis was developed. 

I would like to thank the curators and other organisers who chose to exhibit and showcase artworks made during this thesis, which include Luba Elliot, Xavier Snelgrove, Gemma Murray, Susanna Pousette, Paula Perissinotto, Clarissa Oliveira, Mathieu Arbez Hermoso and Rita Hajj. I would also like to thank Georgie Hoare, Joe Bedell-Brill from the band 0171 for allowing me to test out some of the techniques I was developing in this thesis to make artworks for them and then document that process and include those works in this thesis.

I would like to thank my good friend Joe Collerton for the support during the difficult uncertainties of the first COVID lockdown and the support he gave to this research during this cohabitation. I would like to thank my partner Katie, for her calm and reassuring presence that I so desperately needed the final stages of this PhD. Finally, I would like to thank my Mum and Dad for the constant and unwaivering support they have given me throughout my academic journey.
